v3.7.1: HOTFIX - join TS bug solved (Thanks to Doulin Sheperd).
v3.7.0:
 Developers:
  - Add acquistion order attribute to the CTFTomo to provide a robust matching between tilt-images and CTFTomos.
  - Add method getTsIds to SetOfTomograms (useful when importing coordinates).
  - CTFTomoSeries: add method getCtfTomoFromTi.
  - CTFTomo: add acqOrder to the attributes list used on its copy method.
  - TiltSeriesBase - method generateTltFile expanded: optional input presentAcqOrders to manage the view exclusion.
  - Utils - add method getCommonTsAndCtfElements to intersect tilt images and CTFs based on the value of the
    attribute acquisition order, or index in case it's not present or empty (backwards compatibility)
  - SetOfCTFTomoSeries: add method getTSIds, just the same as for SetOfTiltSeries and SetOfCoordinates3D.
  - Method getTSIds methods simplified. They call now getUniqueValues instead of aggregate.

v3.6.1:
 Users:
  - Collapse the tilt-series tree by default in the tomo data viewer
  - Fix in protocol import TS: when providing mdoc files, label DividedBy2 is now only applied in the case of
    calculating it from fields MinMaxMean, PixelSpacing and CountsPerElectron (case #4).

Developers:
  - Fix: class Tomogram method getDim removed as it did not manage heterogeneous sets correctly when iterating (read the
    header once, stored it and reused). The Volume method is used now instead, as it reads the size from the file
    header for each file.
  - use setFramesFrange when importing TS movies
  - Class Tomogram method getDim removed as it did not manage heterogeneous sets correctly when iterating (read the
    header once, stored it and reused). The Volume method is used now instead, as it reads the size from the file
    header for each file.

v3.6.0:
 
 Users:
  - Tilt series subsets and CTFTomoseries clone the enable flag
  - Acquisition data storage fixed when importing tilt series and tilt series movies (min angle, max angle, and step)

  - Fit vesicles prot nos requesting the tomograms. Refactored.
  - Fix accum dose in TS import without mdoc.
  - Napari 0.4.17 is the default version. boxmanager and tomotwin are now independent

Developers:
  - Improve the Test Centralization layer.
  - Tests for AreTomo2 CTF import added.
  - Expand the method checkTomograms from the Test Centralization Layer.
  - Import tomograms: the acquisition is now copied to both the set and the items.
  - Some refactor in protocol_ts_estimate_ctf.py required for the new CTF code design prots approach.
  - TiltSeries object: expand the method to generate the imod tlt file allowing to consider the excluded views.
  - TS movies not hiding any acquisition parameter to prevent accidental override.
v3.4.1:
  - Update HIV-tiltseries-alignment-reconstruction.json template
  - Update Picking template II
  - Update Relion4 template
v3.4:
  - Compose tilt series: Allowing tilt series with gaps

  - Tomoviewer: Can sort by acquisition order too.
  - Sampling rate in Coordinates3D rounded to 2 decimal places upon visualization.
  - HIV STA template divided into 2: Dynamo STA and Relion4 STA
  - Picking template tutorial (cryolo, eman, deepfinder) changed
  Developers:
  - TestBaseCentralizedLayer: New test class to make more precise assertions on outputs.
  - Adding a method for extracting odd-even filenames
  - Fix schedule execution in protocol for importing coords from Scipion
v3.3:
  - Tomo metadata viewer increase contrast when left clicking on the preview image.
  - Import tilt series movies using a pattern instead of from mdoc files was improved and admits brackets [] in the
    basename of the files.
  - Import tilt series from mdoc now admits numeric base names or base names beginning by a numeric character
  - New config var: NAPARI_ENV_ACTIVATION, used by other plugins. Napari binary installation is centralized here.

  Developers:
  - Coordinates 3D object have a new attribute _score to store the coordinates score, when necessary.
  - SetOfSubTomograms append method now manages the align attribute of the set.

v3.2:
  - New protocol: "Landmarks to 2D coordinates". To jump to SPA from 3d info.
  - Tolerate empty lines in tlt files
  - Motion correction outputs renamed and fixed for odd/even and dose weighted
  - Tilt series can be sent to Xmipp metadata viewer for subsetting/inspection
  - TomoMetadataViewer shows the preview of the slice and some metadata (tiltAxisAngle)
  - Fix: Imod not needed for importing coordinates, unless imod mode is selected
  - Compose tilt series: Added "exclusion words" to filter out mdocs

  Developers:
  - angleAxis1 and angleAxis2 removed from the TomoAcquisition class

v3.1.9:
  - Reconstruction template fixed.
  - Relion 4 /dynamo  template tweaked. Specifically dynamo alignment
  - HIV template tweaked: one 3d classification removed. Mapback uses the 3d class.
  - OddEven functionality reviewed: Tilt Series set and Tomograms set have oddeven attributes/flags and
    there is no need for separate sets anymore. odd and even are internally referenced.
  - Added a new ctf tomo viewer (CtfConsensusTomoViewer)
  - ComposeTS: allowNull control added, removed validation and added _possibleOutputs

  - SetOfSubtomoClasses improved: sampling rate set, coordinates injected

v3.1.7:
  - Templates tweaked: title and some mpi values

  Developers:
  - SetOfCoordinates and SetOfTiltSeries have a getTSIds method to return TS is contained (+ test)

v3.1.6:
  - Tilt order inferred from dose when tlt file has dose
  - Fix: subtomograms with coordinates work in absence of volId
  - HIV-HTA template: removes coords extraction and reconstruction since mapback can be done without them
  - Import Tilt series or Import tilt series movies do not work in streaming anymore
  - Import tomograms outputs "Tomograms" and defines possible outputs. Templates and tests adapted
  - Pyseg workflow template fixed (extra graphs removed)
  - HIV Reconstruction workflow template fixed (tomograms origin taken from mrc)
  - Protocols "fit vesicles" brought here from xmipptomo. Test added with filter by normals.
  Developers:
    - __init__ uses logger now
    - test_transformation fixed
    - SetOfCoordinates refactored internally to deal better with tomograms.
    - SetOfSubtomograms.iterCoordinates --> Mimics SetOfCoordinates behavior

  - Added an option to import the dose accumulation using a tlt file as second column
  - Fix: uses subsets of representatives are more accurate and not always SetOfVolumes
  - Fix: Single import of a numeric tilt series
  - Template for HIV STA improved
 developers:
  - Subtomogram has a constant for its tomoid attribute name: Subtomogram.VOL_NAME_FIELD = "_volName"
  - Add test centralization layer (not finished, but quite advanced and operative for coordinates and subtomograms)
