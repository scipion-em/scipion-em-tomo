v3.7.2:
 Users:
  - Import TS, TSM and tomos: remove double underscore from both the linked filenames and the tsIds.
 Developers:
  - Add to Tomogram and SetOfTomograms the attribute _ctfcorrected, the same way it was added to the tilt-series.
  - Update the TCL based on the previous point.
v3.7.1: HOTFIX - join TS bug solved (Thanks to Doulin Sheperd).
v3.7.0:
 Developers:
  - Add acquistion order attribute to the CTFTomo to provide a robust matching between tilt-images and CTFTomos.
  - Add method getTsIds to SetOfTomograms (useful when importing coordinates).
  - CTFTomoSeries: add method getCtfTomoFromTi.
  - CTFTomo: add acqOrder to the attributes list used on its copy method.
  - TiltSeriesBase - method generateTltFile expanded: optional input presentAcqOrders to manage the view exclusion.
  - Utils - add method getCommonTsAndCtfElements to intersect tilt images and CTFs based on the value of the
    attribute acquisition order, or index in case it's not present or empty (backwards compatibility)
  - SetOfCTFTomoSeries: add method getTSIds, just the same as for SetOfTiltSeries and SetOfCoordinates3D.
  - Method getTSIds methods simplified. They call now getUniqueValues instead of aggregate.

v3.6.1:
 Users:
  - Collapse the tilt-series tree by default in the tomo data viewer

Developers:
  - Fix: class Tomogram method getDim removed as it did not manage heterogeneous sets correctly when iterating (read the
    header once, stored it and reused). The Volume method is used now instead, as it reads the size from the file
    header for each file.
  - use setFramesFrange when importing TS movies
  - Class Tomogram method getDim removed as it did not manage heterogeneous sets correctly when iterating (read the
    header once, stored it and reused). The Volume method is used now instead, as it reads the size from the file
    header for each file.
