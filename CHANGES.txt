  - Scipion metadata viewer for SetOfTomograms and SetOfTomoMasks: updated the visible fields and order.
 Developers:
  - Tilt Series class:
     * Fix the clone method --> now it is a literal clone is expected by default instead
       of ignoring some attributes.
     * Fix TS reStack method.
     * Methods applyTSTransform and generateTltFile updated to work with presentAcqOrders.
  - Import TomoMasks refactored.

v3.8.0:
 Users:

    select the substring that will be considered as tsId.
  - Import TS:
    * Fix the heterogeneous set of TS validation using a range of angles.
    * Multiple TS can be imported without the label {TS}.
  - Join heterogeneous sets are possible for tomography objects TS and tomograms.
  - New protocol correct tilt offset: It allows to correct the tilt offset of a tilt series
  - Fix the protocol tomograms to micrographs. Helps enhanced. ImageHandler replaced by mrcfile.

  - Assign Transformation Matrix: combine alignments removed. Some fixes at metadata level.
Developers:
  - Attribute _acquisition is initialized as None in TSBase, so the coppyAttributes callen in protocol for joining.
    sets work properly. The same whith the attribute _origin.
  - Method hasAcquisition re-defined in TSBase for the same reason exposed in the previous line.
  - Attribute _isHetereogeneous and accessors added to SetOfTomograms and SetOfTiltSeries. Used in the string
    representation of both objects.
  - TiltSeries: method reStack added and applyTransforma refactored. Both related to the management of the excluded
    views.
  - Fix update method in Set of Tomos and Set of TS: It does not turn homogeneous sets into heterogeneous ones, nor
    does it look at the X and Y dimensions because they are considered heterogeneous under the criteria used before.
    Only the third dimension is checked for the heterogeneous set check.
  - CTFTomoSeries: method setNumberOfEstimationsInRangeFromDefocusList can handle now the excluded views.
  - TCL:
    * Attribute _isHetereogeneous checked in the corresponding sets.

  - Import TS, TSM and tomos: remove double underscore from both the linked filenames and the tsIds.
  - Import TS: add a validation for the case of heterogeneous sets of TS in the number of tilt images and providing the
    angular data using a range. The cases avoided with this validation prevents erratic behavior in the subsequent
    protocols.

    attribute acquisition order, or index in case it's not present or empty (backwards compatibility)
  - SetOfCTFTomoSeries: add method getTSIds, just the same as for SetOfTiltSeries and SetOfCoordinates3D.
  - Method getTSIds methods simplified. They call now getUniqueValues instead of aggregate.

Developers:
  - Fix: class Tomogram method getDim removed as it did not manage heterogeneous sets correctly when iterating (read the

    header for each file.
  - use setFramesFrange when importing TS movies
  - Class Tomogram method getDim removed as it did not manage heterogeneous sets correctly when iterating (read the
